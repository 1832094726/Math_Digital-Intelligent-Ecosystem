## 1. INTRODUCTION

Before the advent of cloud computing, traditional computing
models were prevalent. These traditional models depended

```
primarily on local storage and on-premises technology.
However, conventional computing models has constraints
regarding flexibility, cost-efficiency, scalability, and
accessibility [1], [2]. Cloud computing emerged as a disruptive
solution to these constraints, providing on-demand computer
resources, pay-as-you-go pricing, increased collaboration, and
global accessibility via the internet [3], [4]. It transformed the
storage, management, and accessibility of data for individuals
and organisations, ultimately improving technological
integrations and cost-efficiency. Cloud computing is integral in
the 21st century because of its widespread adoption and
beneficial impact. Cloud computing refers to the provision of
computing services such as software, networking, databases,
servers, storage, and analytics [5], [6]. Instead of keeping files
locally, cloud computing uses remote storage systems, which
provide benefits such as speed, availability, productivity,
efficiency, performance, and security [7], [8]. According to
Edge Delta [79], almost 90% of organisations globally use
cloud services. A study conducted by Exploding Topics [80]
reveals that 60% of corporate data is stored in the cloud. The
figure has doubled, rising from just 30% in 2025. As shown in
Figure 1, the projected revenue of the public cloud market is
estimated to reach USD773.30 billion in 2024. This figure will
double to USD 1,567 billion by 2028 [81]. The staggering
growth rate of cloud computing has prompted numerous
research initiatives and focal points across diverse sectors from
the educational sector to agriculture.

```
artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT)
applications [11]–[13].

## 1.2 Finance, Banking and Cloud

## Computing

Cloud computing has transformed the finance and banking
sector by modernising their operations, increasing efficiency,
and encouraging creativity. This paradigm change includes
frictionless access to financial services, cost savings through
scalable infrastructure, and increased data analytics capabilities
[14], [15]. Financial institutions can securely store and handle
substantial data volumes on the cloud, facilitating real-time
transaction processing and analysis for risk management and
fraud detection. Moreover, the cloud has facilitated broader
access to advanced financial products, enhancing financial
inclusion for marginalised communities [16]. Finally, cloud
computing has solidified its role as a cornerstone in the banking
and financial sectors by enhancing agility, security, and client
focus. Cloud computing has significantly transformed the
finance and banking sectors by modernising processes,
enhancing efficiency, and promoting creativity [17], [18]. The
seamless access to financial services, cost efficiencies through
scalable infrastructure, and enhanced data analytics capabilities
are examples of this paradigm change.

## 1.3 Agriculture and Cloud Computing

The agricultural sector has experienced a significant transition
due to cloud computing, enhancing productivity, data
management, and decision-making. Agricultural producers and
organisations can utilise cloud-based platforms to access
extensive real-time data, such as weather forecasts, soil
conditions, and crop performance, enabling informed decisions
about planting, irrigation, and pest management [19], [20]. This
data accessibility has reduced resource waste and
environmental impact while enhancing crop yields.
Additionally, cloud computing has aided the development of
precision agriculture practices, allowing farmers to optimise
their operations, save resources, and boost sustainability. In
conclusion, cloud computing has altered the agricultural
industry by providing the tools and knowledge needed for a
more lucrative, efficient, and sustainable farming sector [21]–
[23]

## 1.4 Manufacturing and Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has transformed the commercial and
manufacturing sectors by providing scalable, cost-effective,
and flexible IT solutions. This technology revolution has
enabled industrial businesses to improve operational efficiency
through real-time data analytics and remote equipment
monitoring, resulting in predictive maintenance and reduced
downtime [24], [25]. Manufacturers utilising cloud services
can access manufacturing and production resources, including
computer numerical control (CNC) machines, 3D printers, and
assembly links on an on-demand basis. This practice enhances
manufacturing output by augmenting capacity, reducing costs,
and facilitating adaptive responses to consumer demands [25].
In addition, cloud-based technologies have simplified supply
chain management, allowing businesses to optimise inventory
levels and improve demand forecasting [26], [27].

## 1.5 Energy Grid and Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has transformed the operation and efficiency
of the energy and utility industries. Organisations in this
business can optimise energy generation, distribution, and
consumption by leveraging big data analytics, IoT devices, and
real-time monitoring via cloud-based solutions. This has
increased client satisfaction, enhanced grid management, and

```
reduced downtime [28], [29]. Cloud-based predictive analytics
enable utilities to anticipate and respond to power outages more
effectively [30]. Furthermore, utilities can adjust their
computer capacities as required with cloud computing, which
reduces infrastructure expenses and enhances flexibility. In
summary, cloud computing has enhanced the energy and utility
industries, facilitating a more sustainable and reliable energy
supply while accommodating the evolving demands of
consumers.
```
## 1.6 Entertainment Industry and Cloud

## Computing

```
Cloud computing has significantly revolutionised the
entertainment industry by offering scalable and cost-effective
solutions for content creation, distribution, and consumption.
The delivery of high-quality content to global audiences by
streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+, which utilise
cloud technology to store vast collections of films and
television programs, exemplifies this transformation [31], [32].
Moreover, cross-border collaboration among filmmakers and
content creators is now feasible due to cloud-based production
tools such as Adobe Creative Cloud and Avid Media
Composer, which have optimised the creative process. The
shift to cloud computing has fostered innovation and variety in
the entertainment sector by democratising content creation and
distribution while reducing infrastructure expenses [33].
```
## 1.7 Educational Sector and Cloud

## Computing

```
Cloud technology in education refers to the storing and retrieval
of student information and course materials. By using the
software for online lesson management, email management,
calendar management, and other tasks. Using ubiquitous
devices and the cloud, it is possible to learn while not
physically present in a particular location [34], [35]. Cloud
computing in education is altering the classroom by using
internet-based technology to store, manage, and access data and
instructional resources. Cloud-based platforms provide flexible
and tailored learning experiences from anywhere with an
internet connection. They also allow for seamless collaboration
between students, teachers, and administrators. Cloud-based
learning management systems (LMS) enable students to access
course materials, coursework, and communication tools from
anywhere with an internet connection. This accessibility has
benefited nontraditional students in particular, such as working
adults and students from remote locations [35], [36]. Cloud-
based tools and software have enabled collaborative and
interactive learning between students and teachers. For
instance, real-time collaboration on documents and
presentations is possible with Google Workspace for
Education. As a result, the traditional classroom has been
transformed into a lively and participatory learning
environment. Additionally, cloud-based video conferencing
services have enabled international collaboration and virtual
classes. Cloud computing has also led to cost savings for
educational institutions. Universities and colleges can reduce
capital expenditures by contracting with cloud service
providers to manage their IT equipment and applications. This
allows them to dedicate more funds to improving educational
standards [37], [38]. The ability to scale is a significant
advantage of cloud computing. Educational institutions can
rapidly adjust their IT resources in accordance with demand.
This is particularly advantageous while executing data-
intensive operations or during times of elevated enrolment.
Education institutions are becoming more effective because of
their improved resource management. Cloud computing has
```

```
Volume 186 – No. 66 , February 2025
```
highlighted concerns regarding data security and privacy in
education [39], [40]. This has become a prominent theme in
recent research on how cloud service providers might use
technology and protocols to secure sensitive educational data.

This study focused on cloud computing in education,
emphasising educational benefits, cloud-based architecture for
pedagogical use, cloud-supported educational applications, and
significant difficulties. In line with the objectives, we pose the
following research questions (RQs) to guide the study:

1. What is cloud computing? What are the potential
    benefits for diverse sectors?
2. What are the emerging trends and architecture in
    cloud computing for education, and how are they
    affecting the future of educational technology?
3. How does cloud-based educational technologies
    influence learning outcomes, student performance,
    engagement, and overall educational effectiveness?
4. What are the challenges associated with the
    implementation of cloud-based educational
    technologies, and what barriers will educational
    institutions face when adopting and integrating
    cloud solutions into their existing infrastructure?

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: First, section 2
discusses the methodological procedure. Second, section 3
examined and surveyed the reviewed literature. Third, section
4 discusses educational trends and areas of interest. Section 5
covers discussion, integrations, and limitations. Finally, section
6 covers the conclusion.

## 2. METHODOLOGY

This study was based on the seven steps to a comprehensive
literature review by Onwuegbuzie & Frels [83]. The model is
an iterative model with all steps interdependent on one another.
As shown in Figure 1, the model applies three main phases,
including the exploration phase, interpretation phase, and
communication phase.

Fig 2: The seven steps to comprehensive literature review

## 2.1 Exploration Phase

```
The exploration phase consists of five steps. The purpose is to
explore the topic and gather information. The first step involves
exploring philosophies and topics to gather an initial
understanding broadly, which is later narrowed as the literature
review progresses. The step was conducted by acquiring
knowledge through informal queries from Google and other
relevant search engines to get a general knowledge of cloud
computing and future trends in education. The initiating the
search step involves reflecting on the results from these
searches to provide a holistic overview of the topic and highly
relevant keywords for searching further literature. We obtained
scholarly papers, dissertations, and books from search engines
and online academic databases such as ACM Digital Library,
Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, ResearchGate, and
Springer. White papers and technical reports were also
obtained through Google searches.
```
```
Fig 3: Initiating the Search
```
```
Steps 3, 4, and 5 includes storing and organising information,
selecting/deselecting information, and expanding the search
modes. Figure 4 shows the how the articles were selected and
organised to arrive at the 53 articles that were relevant to the
objectives. This is based on the Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) [41] method. In Step 4, we employed
combinations of the following keywords as a strategy for
literature search. The keywords and potential combinations
were: To search for cloud computing: "Cloud computing",
"cloud technologies", in education. To investigate prospective
developments in cloud computing: "future trend of cloud
computing", in education. For searching for challenges of cloud
computing: "cloud computing challenges", in education. We
documented our findings and stored them locally in designated
folders for Step 3.
```

Fig 4: Organising Information, Selecting/Deselecting using
Page et al. [41] method

The main purpose of the inclusion criteria for this study is to
select previous studies (published from 2010 to 2023) on cloud
computing and future trends in education.

The article selections that were included:

- Journal articles that describe information on cloud
    computing and future trends.
- Academic studies of impacts and challenges with the
    implementation of cloud computing.
- White papers, reports that are technical, a
    dissertation, or websites with focus on cloud
    computing.

The scrutiny we applied was qualitative and the central focus
was on trusted article sources.

We excluded articles using the following criteria:

- Artiles written in other language apart from English
    or with poor grammatical expressions.
- Studies that has topics on cloud computing but
    content not related to the topic
- Studies published in 2009 or older

## 2.2 Interpretation Phase

The sixth phase of the thorough and extensive literature
research represents the interpretation of the extracted material,
which includes assessing and synthesising it. The literature
search may produce a significant number of results, and the
majority of the job will be investigating prospective
information and books. We ranked the results accordingly,
prioritizing academic sources over books, technical reports,

```
and white papers. Companies seeking financial gain typically
create technical reports, white papers, and similar materials.
Despite their potential to contain legitimate data, companies
may use them to promote or advertise a service. The literature
study gathered and synthesized statistical data on cloud
computing and future trends in education.
```
## 2.3 Communication Phase

```
The final step is to present the systematic or extensive literature
review report. This is essentially a communication phase. This
phase outlines the presentation and dissemination of the
preceding steps' results. Our primary method has been to group
findings by common theme and give references.
```
```
Fig 5: Percentage of Literature
```
```
In addition, we summarised the major findings at the end of
each study to address the research questions. As illustrated in
Figure 5, the visualisation graph reveals that 49% of search
results were related to the explanation of cloud computing, 36%
to the impact of cloud-based educational technologies, 10% to
trends in cloud computing, and 5% to challenges associated
with cloud-based educational technologies.
```
## 3. CLOUD COMPUTING MODELS

```
In today's digital landscape, traditional on-premises
infrastructure has been replaced by cloud computing services,
which offer greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency.
These services include a wide range of resources available over
the internet, such as computing power, storage, databases,
networking, and software. Cloud computing manifests itself in
three types of services: an application provided for users, a
platform of tools provided for testing and running applications,
and an infrastructure for storage capacity shared among
multiple applications via virtualisation techniques enabling
users to access internet-based services [38], [42]. As a result,
users are not need to install, acquire software and hardware,
maintain or upgrade them, or pay for server administration [43].
The majority of the papers assessed focused on three major
services: software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service
(PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Others, however,
captured more complex cloud service concepts, such as
Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS), Database as a
Service (DBaaS), Distance Education as a Service (DEaaS),
Network as a Service (NaaS), and Security as a Service
(SEaaS). Figure 6 depicts the cloud service models that are
referenced in literature. Four of the most compelling cloud
computing models are elaborated upon further.

```
## 3.1 Software as a Service (SaaS)

This is a common cloud service paradigm that consumers may
access using a web browser or any mobile application software.
This upper layer includes fully functional internet-accessible
applications. SaaS model offers software applications as
services through the internet rather than as software bundles
that individual users must acquire. As all processes and
applications are hosted on cloud infrastructure, these service
models necessitate no hardware for installation or maintenance.
The majority of software-as-a-service models are free;
however, some may require a monthly or yearly subscription
charge to access full services. SaaS models include Salesforce,
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Dropbox, and
Google Workspace [84], [85]. Figure 7 shows the use cases of
SaaS model.

```
Fig 7: The Use Cases of SaaS
```
## 3.2 Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS) offers an operating system,
hardware, and network infrastructure to support the complete
application development lifecycle, encompassing design,

```
implementation, debugging, and testing. The development
environment is Internet browsers [47]. This intermediary layer
further simplifies complexity by providing developers with a
platform and environment for building, distributing, and
managing apps. It encompasses tools, middleware, and
development frameworks. The PaaS architecture enables
software developers and web designers to build websites
without the use of software. The PaaS paradigm also enables
developers to completely design, test, share, maintain, and
upgrade apps, resulting in a life-cycle model. Cloud developers
provide businesses with application software, web services or
networks, and business strategy. Furthermore, because the
platform as a service model is self-managed, the developer,
who is also a user, can reduce material expenses while
effectively administering the cloud system [48], [49].
Commonly used PaaS models include EC2 (Amazon), Google
Apps and Salesforce.com [84], [85]. Figure 8 shows the use
cases of PaaS model.
```
```
Fig 8: The Use Cases PaaS
```
## 3.3 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

```
The lowest layer is infrastructure as a service, which offers
virtualised computer resources including virtual machines,
storage, and networking. Users can access the virtualised
resource's operating systems, software, and configurations.
This cloud service offers individuals and businesses hardware
resources, including networks, servers, data storage, and other
essential computing equipment, to ensure optimal performance
of their software and systems. Customers can rent these
resources instead of purchasing dedicated servers and
networking equipment [50], [51]. The IaaS also allows
businesses to obtain access to a wide range of internet platforms
and applications without investing in larger cloud
infrastructures. Cloud IaaS designers verify that the cloud
model's operating system and virtualisation meet the
specifications of the computer model or other technical
equipment [50]. Cisco and IBM hardware services, as well as
S3 (Amazon), are the most popular IaaS options [84], [85].
Figure 9 shows the use cases of IaaS model.

## 3.4 Artificial Intelligence as a Service

## (AIaaS)

AI as a Service (AIaaS) is a cloud computing service enabling
enterprises and individuals to acquire artificial intelligence (AI)
capabilities via a subscription or usage-based basis [51], [52].
This type of service is aimed at enterprises and individuals who
lack the skills, funding, infrastructure, or willingness to create
and implement AI systems on their own. The level of technical
knowledge required to use AI cloud services varies. Some
vendors offer low-code/no-code (LCNC) services, which hide
the complexities of designing and deploying AI models behind
a simple drag-and-drop interface. These vendors include Wipro
Holmes, Huawei Cloud AI, Oracle Cloud AI, IBM Watson, and
Salesforce Einstein Cloud [86]. Figure 10 shows the use cases
of AIaaS model.

## 4. CLOUD-BASED LEARNING

## MODELS FOR EDUCATION

The incorporation of cloud computing technology in education
has created various opportunities in the sector. Cloud
computing has emerged as a viable solution for numerous
areas, including education, owing to its dynamic scalability and
the provision of virtualised resources as a service over the
Internet. Scholars have been investigating the use of cloud
computing in the educational sector since 2008. Plummer et al.
[87] and Kim [54] illustrated how cloud computing was a
significant service provider that would help future generations
in early 2008–2009. From 2010 to 2015, the focus was on
developing a cloud computing infrastructure for education.
Niall [88] and [55] aimed to develop information technology
skills and knowledge through education. Thus, cloud
computing offers higher education institutions a new type of
environment in which classic services are now delivered as
online resources. This allows higher education institutions to
create and use resources in a more flexible way. Furthermore,
cloud-based applications allow for improved management of
educational and technical activities. Academic institutions will
oversee content generation, management, and delivery, whilst
cloud service providers will be responsible for constructing and
managing online systems [56]. The proposed cloud-based
educational technology model must effectively address the
requirements of administrative personnel, including those in
student affairs, finance and accounting, purchasing, and
procurement. It must also address the educational, training, and

```
research requirements of students and academic personnel
primarily engaged in educational institutions. Students,
instructors, school administrators, tutors, academics, and
service providers are the primary users of these cloud-based
educational technology platforms. The SaaS model will
provide all users with interfaces over the internet, removing the
need to install software on client PCs. Bulla [89] conducted a
survey to assess the usage of cloud computing in educational
settings. They examined the usage of cloud computing
platforms as solutions for educational institutions. They also
illustrated the enormous influence of cloud computing on new
teaching and learning environments. Chandra & Borah [57]
conducted an analytical study on the function of cloud
computing in education. The report discusses the use of SaaS
in school education and cloud computing in distance education.
They also explained the Virtual Computing Lab (VCL) idea,
the VCL Community, and presented a case study from Ben-
Gurion University. Ercan [58] illustrated the application of
cloud computing within educational organisations. The study
examined the cloud computing infrastructure in education and
analysed the advantages of prevalent apps for students and
educators.
```
```
Fig 11: Cloud Computing Service Models for Education
[59]
```
```
Mathew [60] and Navish Samyan & Flour [59] discussed the
relevance of the three primary cloud computing models, SaaS,
PaaS, and IaaS for education. As shown in Figure 11, they
suggested that while institutional developers can use the PaaS
to create their own applications, other staff members, such as
administrators, students, teachers, and researchers, use the IaaS
and SaaS for common infrastructure needs and application
support. In addition, institutions can leverage their existing
resources to create a private cloud model devoid of privacy
concerns and security breaches.
```
```
El Mhouti et al. [61] also proposed a standard architecture of
cloud-based learning system as shown in Figure 12. The model
comprising of the physical layer, the services layer, and the
content management layer. The physical layer denotes the
informational infrastructure and resources. It encompasses
pertinent computer elements, including the central processing
unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and storage. The
services layer comprises IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS. These are
virtual machines that provide cloud services integrated into the
system. The topmost layer is the cloud management system. It
facilitates the incorporation of e-learning applications into the
cloud computing framework. This layer functions as an
interface for an e-learning system comprising multiple
subsystems for all participants [61].

## 5. EDUCATIONAL TRENDS IN CLOUD

## COMPUTING

The contemporary educational landscape is experiencing a
significant transformation, with cloud computing serving as a
crucial catalyst in redefining student learning and institutional
operations. The incorporation of cloud computing in
educational settings offers the potential to free institutions from
the challenges of intricate IT infrastructure [62]. Embracing
cloud technology enables educational institutions to focus their
efforts on promoting research and learning opportunities.
Cloud computing applications in education are establishing the
groundwork for future IT progress in the area, including both
hardware and software innovations. Educational institutions
can leverage cloud computing to meet the increasing demand
for high-quality education and manage the issues of
information overload. This integration leverages rapid
improvements in IT and the SaaS trend, improving
instructional materials, decreasing costs, meeting green energy
requirements, strengthening data security, and streamlining
system maintenance and operation. Cloud computing
integration has received global attention, with some
educational institutions in different countries recognizing its
potential to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase
convenience in the education sector. There are several aspects
of this trend towards cloud computing usage [63]. For example,
institutions have begun to rely on third-party suppliers for
services like student email systems, using platforms such as
Microsoft's Live@edu or Google Apps for Education [64].
These platforms offer students access to essential tools such as
email, office suites, and collaborative features without the need
for individual purchases. Shi et al. (2014) discovered that cloud
computing trends in education are focused on five key areas:

```
conceptual and pedagogical aspects, educational applications,
information and resource processing, the benefits and
drawbacks of cloud computing, and the integration of database
management systems with cloud-based services. This broad
scope highlights the multifaceted impact of cloud computing in
educational settings.
```
## 5.1 Cloud of Educational Technologies

## (CET)

```
Technology has emerged as a transformative force in the
rapidly evolving landscape of education, reshaping the
acquisition, sharing, and experience of knowledge. One of the
most groundbreaking innovations in this realm is Cloud of
Educational Technologies (CET), a paradigm that leverages
cloud computing to revolutionize learning environments and
empower educators and learners alike. CET does not only
facilitate seamless access to a wide array of educational tools
and resources but also enhances collaboration, scalability, and
flexibility in educational settings. This aspect of the review
explores the concept of CET, its significance, and its
architecture through an illustrative diagram. The CET is a
comprehensive ecosystem that harnesses cloud computing
infrastructure to provide educators, students, and institutions
with a dynamic and versatile learning environment. Similar to
other cloud-based systems, CET relies on remote servers to
store, manage, and process data, allowing users to access
educational resources and applications from anywhere with an
internet connection. What sets CET apart is its specific focus
on tailoring cloud services to meet the unique demands of
education. CET tackles various issues encountered by
conventional education systems, including restricted resource
access, geographical obstacles, and inflexible learning
```

```
Volume 186 – No. 66 , February 2025
```
frameworks. By transitioning educational tools and materials to
the cloud, CET prevents these obstacles, facilitating a more
accessible and adaptable learning experience. Students can
obtain educational resources, collaborate on assignments, and
participate in interactive activities irrespective of their
geographical location. Educators get the flexibility to create
and present dynamic curriculum, monitor progress, and offer
customised feedback. A plethora of cloud computing programs

```
currently exists, many of which possess considerable utility in
educational settings. These applications include numerous
instruments vital to the educational industry, as noted by [66].
Significant examples encompass systems such as Google
Slides, Apple Pages, Apple Keynote, Microsoft Word,
Microsoft PowerPoint, OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive,
Google Docs, Capture to Cloud, Apple iCloud, Amazon Cloud
Drive, Memopal, and SugarSync.
```
```
Fig 13: A visual representation of the CET Architecture
```
As shown in Figure 13, the CET architecture comprises of the
physical layer, the IaaS layer, and the SaaS layer. The CET
architecture provides the following robust benefits:

Cloud Servers: These are the backbone of the CET, hosting a
wide range of educational resources, applications, and tools.
Servers are distributed across data centres to ensure reliability,
scalability, and efficient resource allocation.

Educational Content Repository: This repository houses a
vast collection of digital learning materials, including
textbooks, videos, simulations, and interactive modules. The
repository is accessible to both educators and students, which
facilitates easy content sharing and customization.

Collaboration Tools: CET incorporates tools for real-time

Personalized Learning Platforms: These platforms use data
analytics and artificial intelligence to deliver personalized
learning experiences. Students receive tailored
recommendations, assessments, and resources based on their
learning styles, progress, and preferences.

```
Assessment and Feedback Systems: Cloud-based assessment
tools allow educators to design and administer quizzes, tests,
and assignments. Automated grading and detailed analytics
provide timely feedback to both students and educators.
```
```
Security and Privacy: A robust security framework ensures
data protection and compliance with privacy regulations. User
authentication, encryption, and secure connections safeguard
sensitive information.
```
```
Scalability and Resource Allocation: The cloud's scalability
enables seamless resource allocation, ensuring that educational
institutions can accommodate varying numbers of users
without compromising performance.
```
```
This innovative paradigm provides a flexible and inclusive
learning environment that transforms the interaction between
educators and students with educational resources. CET's
architecture, engineered for collaboration, personalisation, and
scalability, is positioned to advance the future of education,
empowering both learners and educators in their educational
pursuits. Educational technologies are divided into two core
domains: administration and teaching and learning, which
cover many aspects of education. The administrative domain
includes Human Resource Management (HRM) and decision
support systems. Assessment systems, learning management
systems, library systems, admission systems, laboratory
```

```

### Systems

Cloud computing has significantly influenced educational
decision support systems. These systems employ cloud
platforms to deliver critical insights and information to
educators, administrators, and policymakers, thereby
improving educational quality and facilitating informed
decision-making [67]. Educational Decision Support Systems
(EDSS) aid educational institutions in making data-informed
decisions to better student outcomes, improve instructional
methods, and optimise resource allocation. Cloud computing
provides the infrastructure and tools essential for EDSS to
collect, evaluate, and display data in real-time. This enables
educators and administrators to access precise and current
information, resulting in more informed decision. A primary
advantage of cloud-based EDSS is its scalability and flexibility.
Educational institutions can readily adjust their scale according
to their requirements without necessitating costly and time-
intensive hardware enhancements. This adaptability is
especially crucial in the ever-evolving field of education, where
alterations in curriculum, student demographics, and
pedagogical approaches are prevalent. Additionally, cloud-
based EDSS allows educators to customise learning

```
experiences for students. Through the analysis of data
regarding student performance, engagement, and behaviour,
educators can discern trends and patterns that guide
instructional practices. For instance, if the data indicates that a
specific cohort of students is encountering difficulties with a
particular idea, instructors might customise their instructional
strategies to meet those distinct requirements. Furthermore,
cloud-based EDSS can enhance communication and
collaboration among diverse stakeholders within the
educational ecosystem. Educators, administrators, students,
and parents can access the system remotely and at any time,
facilitating the smooth exchange of information and insights.
This transparent communication cultivates a cooperative
atmosphere in which all stakeholders collaborate to attain
shared educational objectives. Cloud-based educational
decision support systems have revolutionised the methods by
which educational institutions collect and analyse data for
informed decision-making. The scalability, adaptability, and
customisation features of these systems promote student
performance and improve instructional methodologies. With
the ongoing advancement of technology, the use of cloud

about data breaches, unauthorised access, and data loss occur
while keeping this data in the cloud. Security breaches can have
major consequences, such as reputational damage and legal
concerns [75]. To prevent these dangers, institutions must use
robust security measures such as encryption, multi-factor
authentication, and frequent security audits [76]. It is also
critical to choose cloud service providers who have a proven
track record of data security and industry standard compliance.

## 7.2 Privacy

Privacy concerns are intimately linked to security issues. When
using cloud-based educational technologies, educational
institutions must ensure that instructor and student privacy is
respected. These challenges could involve the collection and
storage of personally identifiable information (PII), biometric
data, and learning analytics. To address privacy concerns,
institutions must have strict data protection policies and follow
relevant laws, such as the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA) in the United States [90]. Furthermore,
when collecting sensitive data, institutions should obtain
express consent and set clear data usage guidelines [91].

## 7.3 Facility Readiness

The success of cloud-based educational technology relies
heavily on the institution's IT infrastructure. Many educational
institutions, particularly smaller ones, struggle with the
infrastructure that they already have. This includes internet
connectivity, hardware compatibility, and network bandwidth.

```
Institutions should conduct thorough assessments to identify
gaps in infrastructure readiness and make the necessary
investments to improve their infrastructure [77], [78]. It may
also be helpful to collaborate with cloud service providers to
improve platform performance.
```
## 7.4 Development Capacity

```
Modifications to pedagogical and administrative protocols are
often requisite when implementing cloud-based educational
systems. Faculty, staff, and students must undergo training to
utilise these resources efficiently. The efficient implementation
of cloud technologies may be hindered by inadequate training
and capacity-building efforts. Institutions ought to allocate
resources for comprehensive training programs and provide
continuous support to staff and educators [68]. Facilitating
peer-to-peer learning and the dissemination of best practices
can enhance the institution's capabilities.
```
## 7.5 Budgetary Restrictions

```
Cost constraints provide a substantial hurdle when
incorporating cloud educational tools. Despite the substantial
initial investment, these technologies may yield long-term cost
savings through reduced hardware and maintenance expenses.
Expenses for data migration, licensing, and ongoing
subscriptions are incorporated. Institutions ought to do a cost-
benefit analysis to ascertain the long-term advantages of cloud
technology for effective budget management [34].
Furthermore, exploring open-source and cost-effective options
might alleviate financial burdens. In summary, addressing the
pertinent issues is crucial for effective implementation. A
primary challenge that institutions must address is financial
constraints. Additional considerations encompass security and
privacy concerns, infrastructure preparedness, capacity
development, and training. Educational institutions can
overcome these challenges and fully leverage cloud education
technology by implementing robust security protocols,
ensuring data privacy, modernising infrastructure, providing
adequate training, and meticulously monitoring expenditures.
Institutions must be vigilant and adaptable in their
implementation of cloud technology as the educational
landscape evolves.
